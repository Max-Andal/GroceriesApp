Groceries Market App


The app is for grocery shopping and its designed to have categories of fruits and vegetables and have impressive Grid that you can choose which object you need to buy.

What I learned Coding this app is how to make complex and functional apps without messing the quality of the product.

In terms of technicality I learned how to use Providers and use them to flow data across all the pages.

I also learned that it’s possible to do complex and functional systems using simple and well know Widgets and you don’t have to be advanced and Geek to do it.

In terms of future am willing to make it super functional and add backend (FirebaseFirestore+FirebaseAuth) to this app to make it even better.

I took the idea from MitchKoko a YouTuber with a lot of good content.
